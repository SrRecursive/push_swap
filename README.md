# push_swap

## Description

Push_swap is a function that sorts in ascending order a stack (stack a) using a temporal stack (stack b).

### Allowed Operations

- **sa**: Swaps the first two elements at the top of **stack a**.
- **sb**: Swaps the first two elements at the top of **stack b**.
- **ss**: Does **sa** and **sb** at the same time.
- **pa**: If **stack b** is not empty, puts the first element at the top into **stack a**.
- **pb**: If **stack a** is not empty, puts the first element at the top into **stack b**.
- **ra**: Shifts up all elements of **stack a** by 1. So the first element becomes the last one.
- **rb**: Shifts up all elements of **stack b** by 1. So the first element becomes the last one.
- **rr**: Does **ra** and **rb** at the same time.
- **rra**: Shifts down all elements of **stack a** by 1. So the last element becomes the first one.
- **rrb**: Shifts down all elements of **stack b** by 1. So the last element becomes the first one.
- **rrr**: Does **rra** and **rrb** at the same time.

The goal is to sort the stack in the lowest amount of operations possible.

### Bonus

I have to create a function that has to replicate the behaviour of the given checker for push_swap.
